/* After the library is initialized, a major number is available.
 * As soon as a low-level bus driver is registered (above routine
 * returns a 'busno'), a device node can be created in the filesystem
 * with a major/minor number pair of
 *
 *    rtems_libi2c_major / RTEMS_LIBI2C_MAKE_MINOR(busno, i2caddr)
 *
 * and a 'raw' hi-level driver is then attached to this device
 * node.
 * This 'raw' driver has very simple semantics:
 *
 *   'open'         sends a start condition
 *   'read'/'write' address the device identified by the i2c bus# and address
 *                  encoded in the minor number and read or write, respectively
 *                  a stream of bytes from or to the device. Every time the
 *                  direction is changed, a 're-start' condition followed by
 *                  an 'address' cycle is generated on the i2c bus.
 *   'close'        sends a stop condition.
 *
 * Hence, using the 'raw' driver, e.g., 100 bytes at offset 0x200 can be
 * read from an EEPROM by the following pseudo-code:
 *
 *   mknod("/dev/i2c-54", mode, MKDEV(rtems_libi2c_major, RTEMS_LIBI2C_MAKE_MINOR(0,0x54)))
 *
 *   int fd;
 *   char off[2]={0x02,0x00};
 *
 *   fd = open("/dev/i2c-54",O_RDWR);
 *   write(fd,off,2);
 *   read(fd,buf,100);
 *   close(fd);
 *
 */

/* Higher Level Driver API
 *
 * Higher level drivers know how to deal with specific i2c
 * devices (independent of the bus interface chip) and provide
 * an abstraction, i.e., the usual read/write/ioctl access.
 *
 * Using the above example, such a high level driver could
 * prevent the user from issuing potentially destructive write
 * operations (the aforementioned EEPROM interprets any 3rd
 * and following byte written to the device as data, i.e., the
 * contents could easily be changed!).
 * The correct 'read-pointer offset' programming could be
 * implemented in 'open' and 'ioctl' of a high-level driver and
 * the user would then only have to perform harmless read
 * operations, e.g.,
 *
 *    fd = open("/dev/i2c.eeprom",O_RDONLY) / * opens and sets EEPROM read pointer * /
 *    ioctl(fd, IOCTL_SEEK, 0x200)			/ * repositions the read pointer       * /
 *    read(fd, buf, 100)
 *    close(fd)

/* NOTES: The bus a device is attached to is LOCKED from the first send_start
 *        until send_stop is executed!
 *
 *        Bus tenure MUST NOT span multiple system calls - otherwise, a single
 *        thread could get into the protected sections (or would deadlock if the
 *		  mutex was not nestable).
 *		  E.g., consider what happens if 'open' sends a 'start' and 'close'
 *		  sends a 'stop' (i.e., the bus mutex would be locked in 'open' and
 *        released in 'close'. A single thread could try to open two devices
 *        on the same bus and would either deadlock or nest into the bus mutex
 *        and potentially mess up the i2c messages.
 *
 *        The correct way is to *always* relinquish the i2c bus (i.e., send 'stop'
 *		  from any driver routine prior to returning control to the caller.
 *		  Consult the implementation of the generic driver routines (open, close, ...)
 *		  below or the examples in i2c-2b-eeprom.c and i2c-2b-ds1621.c
 *
 * Drivers just pass the minor number on to these routines...
