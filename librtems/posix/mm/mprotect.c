 *
 * This is not a functional version of mprotect() but the SPARC backend
 * for at least gcc 2.8.1 plus gnat 3.13p and gcc 3.0.1 require it to
 * be there and return 0.
 *
 * As of gcc 4.2.2, the gcc SPARC backend doesn't appear to have a
 * way to call this for RTEMS anymore but it doesn't hurt to leave it.
