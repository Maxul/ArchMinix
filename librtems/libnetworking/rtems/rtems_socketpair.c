/*
 *  socketpair() for RTEMS
 *
 *  This file exists primarily to document what is required to provide
 *  a functional implementation of socketpair() for RTEMS.
 *
 *  The socketpair() service requires that the "local domain" sockets
 *  be functional.  This is denoted by the domain constants AF_LOCAL
 *  and AF_UNIX and the protocol constants PF_LOCAL and PF_UNIX.  The
 *  local domain functionality is implemented in the file kern/uipc_usrreq.c
 *  which was not part of the initial port of the FreeBSD stack to
 *  RTEMS.
 *
 *  The FreeBSD socketpair implementation appears to be dependent on
 *  file system features which are not available currently in RTEMS.
