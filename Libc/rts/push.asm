; The __push_rts routine saves the SOE registers on the stack
; The __pop_rts routine restores the SOE registers from the stack
; Each function modifies the SP appropriately

;******************************************************************************
; IMPORTANT NOTE:
;    The Table Driven Exception Handling needs to know the stack adjustment
;    in this routine and the order in which the registers are pushed to stack
;    to correctly unwind the stack. This unwinding is implemented in 
;    the function process_unwind() in tdeh_pr_c6000.cpp. Look for the unwinding
;    for the encoding __c6xabi_pop_rts in this function. 
;    If you make any changes to the following routines that either changes the 
;    stack usage or the order in which the registers are pushed, corresponding
;    changes should be made in the unwinding code mentioned above.
