+ newlib 1.8.0 has the wrong prototype for at least read() and write().

+ There should be a "eat it" stub for all system calls which are
  available to make filling out an operations table easier.  
  See device_lseek() for an example of where this would be nice.

+ Fix strerror() so it prints all error numbers.

+ Check the node allocation coment in the fchdir call.
+ Add an interface somewhere for this call.
