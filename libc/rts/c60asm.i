;*       This file provides a set of pseudo-operations that are intended     *
;*       to replace the "B" and "BNOP" branch instructions in certain        *

;*       tools to provide more precise information to the profiler as to     *
;*       the *purpose* of a branch, so that it can provide more accurate     *
;*       profile data.                                                       *
