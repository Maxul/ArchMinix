;* __c6xabi_get_tp() - This function must return the Thread Pointer (TP) of   *
;*                     the current thread. The definition provided below is   *
;*                     a stub that returns the main thread's TP and supports  *
;*                     the usecase where there is only one thread.            *
;*                                                                            *
;*                     Multiple threads are usually supported by a thread     * 
;*                     library that creates and manages threads. Such a       *
;*                     thread library must provide a version of this function *
;*                     that returns the current thread's TP. This function is *
;*                     defined weak. Hence, if a strong (non-weak) definition *
;*                     is provide by the thread-library, it will be linked-in.*

;*  NOTE: This function must not modify any register other than the return    *
;*        register A4.                                                        *
