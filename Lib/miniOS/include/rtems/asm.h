 *
 * @brief Addresses Incompatible Flavors Problems
 *
 *  This include file attempts to address the problems
 *  caused by incompatible flavors of assemblers and
 *  toolsets.  It primarily addresses variations in the
 *  use of leading underscores on symbols and the requirement
 *  that register names be preceded by a %.
 *
 *  NOTE: The spacing in the use of these macros
 *        is critical to them working as advertised.
